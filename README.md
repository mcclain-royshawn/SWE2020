Purpose

This system is created with the purpose to assist faculty with the development of their students course schedules during their collegiate career. The system will provide a PDF that shows the incomplete general education courses for their remaining years at Philander-Smith College. This can help reduce the paperwork required and thus improve efficiency in course scheduling.

Scope

The scope of this system is to assist Philander-Smith College faculty with advising students in which general education classes they should take. This system will provide students with an efficient schedule of general education classes to assist them in obtaining their degree.

Objectives

The system will prove successful if it is able to:
Generate a PDF with a studentâ€™s courses to be completed
Not recommend courses that the student has already completed.
Allow the faculty to select courses that they have already taken.
